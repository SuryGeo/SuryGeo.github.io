###  About Me

I am a research assistant working with [Prof. Guowen Xu](https://faculty.swjtu.edu.cn/xuguowen/zh_CN/index/380597/list/index.htm) at the [School of Civil Engineering](https://civil.swjtu.edu.cn/), [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://www.swjtu.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **computer vision**, **deep learning**, and **tunnel engineering**, with a particular focus on applying intelligent perception and data-driven methods to underground engineering problems, such as surrounding rock characterization, excavation monitoring, and construction automation.

In addition to research, I have strong experience in **secondary development of engineering software**, including **Rhinoceros (Rhino)**, **AutoCAD**, **Revit**, and **CATIA**, supporting digital modeling, data extraction, and intelligent construction workflows.  
My primary programming language is **C#**, and I am also familiar with engineering-oriented algorithm development and system integration.

I am passionate about bridging **civil engineering problems** with **advanced computational methods**, and translating algorithms into practical engineering tools.
